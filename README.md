# LuaBridgeDemo

The LuaBridgeDemo is a stand-alone graphical program for compiling and running
the test suite with an included interactive window where you can enter execute
Lua statements in a persistent environment. The demo has these features:

- Cross platform: Compiles on Mac OS, Windows, iOS, Android, and GNU/Linux

- No external dependencies: Comes with Lua, LuaBridge, and [JUCE][5], just build and run!

- Demonstrates the usage of LuaBridge with functional code.

Also included is a separate project for building a command line version of
the test suite, suitable as a starting point for building an automated
testing suite.

[LuaBridge][3] is a lightweight, dependency-free library for making C++ data,
functions, and classes available to Lua. It works with Lua revisions starting
from 5.1.2. [Lua][4] is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting
language.

This is what the application looks like:
